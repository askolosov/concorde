* Concorde! Concorde, speak to me!
  
  Concorde is my squire, who helps me to deal with email. His main job
  is to yell 'Message for you, Sir!', when an interesting email
  message appears in my inbox.

  Technically, Concorde is a set ofscripts to orchestrate the notmuch
  email indexing system.

  Concorde understands instructions on how to sort out the incoming
  mail, written in simple notmuch-tag-batch-like DSL.

  Concorde is able to automatically tag letters based on:
  - recipient subaddress (e.g. alexander+github@kolosov.xyz);
  - standard maillist headers;
  - spam status (using bogofilter).
